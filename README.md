## Overview

This repository implements the Magic-Wormhole "Transit Relay", a server that helps clients establish bulk-data transit connections even when both are behind NAT boxes. Each side makes a TCP connection to this server and presents a handshake. Two connections with identical handshakes are glued together, allowing them to pretend they have a direct connection.

**Shipped version:** 0.4.0~ynh1
